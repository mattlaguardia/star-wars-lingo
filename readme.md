## Planning Phase

When deciding on a game that I wanted to create I was researching some browser games in JavaScript. During this process I noticed there were not word games with a Star Wars Theme. I decided that I wanted to fix this problem and create one of my own. Once I did some research of the Star Wars API I decided for ease I should just keep to the topic of characters, because who doesn't know Luke Skywalker...

To help plan for this project I used Trello to help focus my thoughts and to refer to for my user stories.

For WireFrames - I used a pen and some paper to make my frame.

## Planned features
  - Star Wars api
  - User Input
  - Hint Button
  - See Length of Character Name
  - First Letter is Shown
  - Countdown Timer

##  Installation instructions (How to Contribute)
- Fork and clone it down
- Work in Index.html style.css and app.js
- Should have access to the Star Wars API

## Shoutouts

- Jen for letting me bounce ideas around and helping me talk about what I needed to create
- Ben for being a troll
- Kabah for working together on some functions
